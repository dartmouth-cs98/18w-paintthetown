Our feedback from users was very positive. Many people seemed pretty excited about the game. We would definitely need to add more features to build the app out and make it more enticing for users to continue to use. If we had more time, we would have built out the challenges scene and shop scene and added in the functionality of adding friends and connecting people through the game. What definitely worked with our group is that we stayed very committed to checking in and making sure our milestones and issues page reflected the work everyone was doing. People felt very comfortable sharing their ideas and opinions on how to move forward.
