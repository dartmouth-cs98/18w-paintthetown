Last term was all about setting up the foundation for our game in Unity, so this term, we focused on all of the necessary functionality 
and appropriate user flows to produce a concrete game app. What worked this term was staying committed to checking in and making sure our
milstones/issues page reflected the work everyone was doing. What didn't work was making continual forward progress; we sometimes got 
stuck on the same tasks for multiple milestones. Higher accountability for our deadlines could have made this a better experience so that 
we stayed on track. Our feedback from users were generally very positive and exciting. We had multiple people return to our final demo 
who had seen it at the end of our winter term, and they were very impressed with our progress. If we could take this further and had more
time, we would definitely add more features to build the app out and make it more enticing for users to continue to play. We would have 
added much more to the Challenges Scene, completed a Shop Scene, and added more of social interaction aspect amongst users. Overall, we 
are very happy with what we produced and how much we accomplished.


What tim's looking for:
1. a brief summary / debrief of this term including:
2. what worked this term / didnâ€™t work
3. brief summary of any insights from user testing / conclusions drawn
4. any potential next steps (if you were going to take this further)
5. what would have made this a better experience?
